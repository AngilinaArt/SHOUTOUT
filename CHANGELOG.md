# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- fix(client): eliminate macOS ghosting/phantom of toasts on Apple Silicon (transparent Electron window + backdrop-filter). Added compositing hints (`translateZ(0)`, `backface-visibility: hidden`, `will-change`, `contain: paint`) and a short fade-out before removal to force clean repaints. Docs updated in README Troubleshooting.

- fix(client/status): apply the same anti-ghosting compositing hints and fade-out to Status overlay.
- fix(client/reaction): apply the same anti-ghosting compositing hints and fade-out to Reaction overlay.
- fix(client/userlist): apply the same compositing hints and fade-out to Online Users overlay.
- fix(client/hamster): renderer now prefers data URLs from main process; added `onerror` fallback to generic icon to avoid file:// 404s.
- fix(client/main): fetch hamster images via Node `http/https` and convert to data URLs to avoid CSP/CORP issues across machines; removed direct cross-origin image fallback in renderer.
- fix(client/csp): relaxed `img-src` CSP earlier; superseded by data-URL approach (kept safe defaults).
- security(server/ws): enforce WS token on `/ws` (query `?token=`). Expected token is `WS_TOKEN` or falls back to `BROADCAST_SECRET` when unset. Keeps `ALLOW_NO_AUTH=false` by default.
- security(server/headers): set `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` for hamster images and configure Helmet with `crossOriginResourcePolicy` (defensive; no longer required when clients use data URLs).
- ops(docker-compose): require runtime secrets via env (`BROADCAST_SECRET`, optional `WS_TOKEN`, `ALLOW_NO_AUTH=false`). Supports project-level `.env` without committing secrets.

- feature(server/self-revoke): add `DELETE /revoke-self` allowing a client to revoke its own token using `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (no admin secret). Closes any WS using that token.
- improvement(client/logout): when logging out, the client now best-effort calls `/revoke-self` with its token before deleting local credentials and restarting. Admin list reflects removal immediately.
- feature(server/auth-check): add `GET /auth-check` for clients to validate their token without side effects (200 or 401).
- improvement(client/reconnect): `Reconnect` now opens the invite prompt if no token is stored or if `/auth-check` returns 401 for the current token; otherwise proceeds to reconnect.

## 2025-08-22 ‚Äî Owner Binding, Admin UI, Ghosting Fixes

- feature(server/owner-binding): tokens now carry metadata `{ ownerId, deviceId, createdAt, lastUsedAt }`. WS handshake and `/auth-check` enforce that header `x-client-user` matches the token's `ownerId` (401 on mismatch). `/broadcast` authorization also checks the owner to prevent HTTP bypass.
- feature(client/ids): client persists stable `userId` and `deviceId` in `shoutout-user.json` and sends them on `/invite` and WS headers (`x-client-user`, `x-client-device`).
- feature(server/admin-ui/columns): admin token list shows Owner (prefix), Name (current display name if connected), Device (prefix), Last Used.
- feature(server/admin/reassign-owner): added `PATCH /reassign-owner/:token` (admin only) to change a token's ownerId; all WS using that token are closed with code `4001` ("Token owner changed"). Admin UI adds an ‚ÄúOwner‚Ä¶‚Äù action per row.
- fix(server/invite-disable): `/invite` returns 403 `invite_disabled` when no invite codes are configured (neither env `INVITE_CODES` nor `server/config/invites.json`).
- change(client/revoke-flow): when a token is revoked or owner changed (WS code 4001), client clears local token, shows re-auth prompt, and reconnects after success (no app restart).
- fix(client/logout-dialog): prevent double dialog on logout with a reentrancy guard; logout now best‚Äëeffort calls `/revoke-self` then restarts.
- improvement(client/tray-gating): when not connected, only ‚ÄúüîÑ Reconnect‚Äù and ‚Äú‚ùå Quit‚Äù remain clickable; all other actions (Change Name, Toast, Hamsters, Translate, Online Users, About, Logout, DND, Autostart) are disabled.
- improvement(client/reconnect/telemetry): added `/auth-check` usage with `x-client-user`; status overlay warns on temporary server unreachability.
- improvement(client/invite+name UI): refreshed to glass style, enlarged, and aligned with Compose window. Applied macOS ghosting workarounds (compositing hints, stable blur backplate, native vibrancy on macOS).
- improvement(server/admin-csp+login): CSP hardened via nonces; Admin UI no longer requires `?secret=` in URL ‚Äî shows a login field and stores secret in sessionStorage for API calls. Favicon handled with 204.
- ops(ci): removed `WS_TOKEN` from client build workflow; client relies on invite/token onboarding.

## 2025-08-21 ‚Äî Invite/Auth, Admin Dashboard, Force Logout

- feature(server/invite): added POST `/invite` to exchange a valid invite code for a client token. Invite codes are read from `INVITE_CODES` env or optional `server/config/invites.json`.
- feature(server/tokens): tokens are stored in `server/config/tokens.json` and now persist as objects `{ token, createdAt }`. Legacy arrays of strings auto-upgrade on next write.
- feature(server/auth): all protected routes validate with issued tokens when the invite system is active. `/broadcast` now expects `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. WebSocket `/ws` accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (preferred) or legacy `?token=` query.
- feature(server/admin-api): added admin endpoints secured by `ADMIN_SECRET`:
  - GET `/tokens` ‚Üí returns list of `{ prefix, createdAt }` (no full tokens)
  - DELETE `/revoke/:token` ‚Üí revokes by exact token or unique prefix; response `{ revoked, closed }` where `closed` is the number of WS connections terminated.
- feature(server/admin-ui): added GET `/admin?secret=<ADMIN_SECRET>` ‚Äî a tiny HTML dashboard (no frameworks) that lists tokens, and allows revoking via the admin API. Uses the `secret` query value as the Authorization header for calls.
- feature(server/revoke-ws): when a token is revoked, all active WebSocket connections that used that token are immediately closed with code `4001` and reason `"Token revoked"`.
- feature(client/invite): on first launch or if no token is stored, show a small ‚ÄúInvite-Code eingeben‚Äù window. On success, the token is stored at `app.getPath('userData')/shoutout-auth.json` (encrypted with `safeStorage` when available).
- feature(client/ws-auth): client connects WS with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; falls back to legacy `WS_TOKEN` query when no invite is configured.
- feature(client/logout): new tray item ‚Äúüîê Logout (Token zur√ºcksetzen)‚Äù l√∂scht die lokale Token-Datei, widerruft best-effort per `/revoke-self`, zeigt eine Best√§tigung und startet die App neu.
- change(client/revoke-flow): wenn der Server die Verbindung mit Code `4001` (Token widerrufen) schlie√üt, √∂ffnet der Client jetzt ein Re-Auth Prompt (Invite-Code) und verbindet neu ‚Äî kein App-Restart mehr.
- ops(server/env): `server/env.example` now documents `INVITE_CODES` and adds `ADMIN_SECRET=super-admin-123`.
- ops(git): `server/config/.gitignore` ignores `tokens.json` so issued tokens are never committed.

Notes & Compatibility
- If no invite codes are configured and there are no issued tokens, the server falls back to the previous single-secret behavior (`BROADCAST_SECRET` / `WS_TOKEN`). Set `ALLOW_NO_AUTH=false` in production.
- Token store format changed from array-of-strings to array-of-objects with `createdAt`. Existing files are auto-upgraded when the server persists the token store.

How to Test Locally
- Server setup
  - In `server/.env` set:
    - `INVITE_CODES=supersecret1,supersecret2`
    - `ADMIN_SECRET=super-admin-123`
    - `ALLOW_NO_AUTH=false`
  - Start the server. Verify health at `GET /health`.

- Invite/token issuance
  - `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/invite -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"inviteCode":"supersecret1"}'`
  - Response includes `{ "token": "..." }`; `server/config/tokens.json` will have `{ token, createdAt }` entries.

- Auth on /broadcast
  - `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/broadcast -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"type":"toast","message":"Hi"}'`
  - Expect `{ ok: true, sent: N }` if clients are connected.

- WebSocket auth
  - Start the Electron client. On first run it asks for an invite code. Enter `supersecret1`.
  - After success, the client auto-connects WS with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and can receive messages.

- Admin API
  - List tokens: `curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer super-admin-123' http://localhost:3001/tokens`
  - Revoke (by prefix or full token): `curl -X DELETE -H 'Authorization: Bearer super-admin-123' http://localhost:3001/revoke/<prefix-or-token>`
  - Response includes `{ revoked, closed }` and logs: `Revoked token <prefix> by admin` and `Closed X WS connection(s) ...`.

- Admin Dashboard (HTML)
  - Visit `http://localhost:3001/admin?secret=super-admin-123`.
  - The table lists tokens with prefix + createdAt. Click ‚ÄúRevoke‚Äù to delete. Upon success, the row is removed and an alert shows how many connections were closed.

- Client logout flows
  - Manual: tray ‚Üí ‚Äúüîê Logout (Token zur√ºcksetzen)‚Äù ‚Üí dialog ‚Üí app restarts ‚Üí invite prompt appears.
  - Forced: revoke the token used by the client ‚Üí WS closes with code `4001` ‚Üí client auto-deletes token and restarts to re-run onboarding.
